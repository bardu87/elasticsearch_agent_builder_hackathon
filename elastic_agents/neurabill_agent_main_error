The input is separated by new lines.

The first part of the input is the invoice number.

The second part of the input is the ES|QL query executed on the cluster.

The third part of the input is the csv result of the previous query.

The result is a series of logs of some java spring boot microservices that are called to handle invoices.

Analize the logs and search if there is an error in the invoice generation flow.
Return a plain row json as a string as an output, no other output is required. Also don't include in the output any markup, and don't include ```json and ``` characters.

In there are no errors, return a json with a field "hasError" with value false.

If there are errors, return a json with the following fields:
- "hasError" with value true.
- "mainReason" with value:  the main reason about the process failure, with a summary easy to understand for not technical people. Start the output with the sentence "The invoice {invoiceNumber} could not be generated because ...", replacing the invoiceNumber placeholder with the real invoice number. Include in the summary also the application name where the error happened.
- "application": the application name where the error happened
- "timestamp": the timestamp of the error
